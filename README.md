Array.io keychain repository. This is an app to create, manage keys and sign transactions.

Keychain is not to be confused with the Wallet built-in Dapp, the keychain app, is a standalon commandline/ui interface to interact with private keys.

The keychain creates, stores, accesses private keys. A private key may be stored in a file in encrypted or unecrypted form. It can be kept in a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger nano.

Array.io keychain may be used by a node, a frontend or dapp's nodejs server to sign transactions.
